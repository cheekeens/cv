        <p><em>Artist, Web Developer, Traveller</em></p>
        <p>I am aspiring to be a better artist. I used to draw doodles on the back of my lecture notebooks more than actually write down my lectures. I wanted to be able to travel to different countries and document them through videos and photos. I am
        quite the introvert that need to have her own space sometimes. I have chubby doxy named Leila who loves to sleep, eat and bark with confidence. Overall, creating something, anything with passion gives me so much joy, energy and positivity.</p>
